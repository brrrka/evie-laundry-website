# Evie Laundry Management System

This website is developed to assist with the administrative processes of laundry businesses, specifically focusing on **Evie Laundry**, a laundry service based in Padang, Indonesia. The current administrative process at Evie Laundry is manual and paper-based, and this system aims to digitize and streamline daily operational data recording.

The website has features designed to make it easier for administrators to manage daily operations efficiently. The project emphasizes the implementation of a **relational database** in the back-end and uses a **Laravel template** for the front-end.

## Key Features
- **Normalized Database**: The database is normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF), reducing redundancy and ensuring efficient relational data management.
- **Authentication**: A secure login and registration system for laundry employees, ensuring that only authorized staff can access the system.
- **Order Management**: The admin can record every transaction, including check-in and check-out dates, services used, quantity, and other transaction details. This feature includes customer information and the staff responsible for the transaction.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:
- **PHP 8.x**
- **Laravel 9.x**
- **MySQL / MariaDB**
